							bobbing in the tidal wash. What might appear at first as an unassuming tuft of green
							clover sparsely dotting the edges of shoals and barrier islands along the Atlantic coast,
							Amaranthus pumilus - commonly called seabeach amaranth - lives a dynamic life.
							Amaranth thrives in the perpetual flux of coastal habitation, growing in the overwash
							and sedimentary deposits formed by the natural ebb and flow of tidal waves. An
							invaluable member of early succession ecosystems, amaranth's ability to put down
							roots in this shifting landscape helps form and stabilise sand dunes while
							simultaneously limiting natural coastal erosion. </p>

							The story of seabeach amaranth is one of
									potentiality, the germinal development offering a unity through which the world may
									be seized and transformed. Seabeach amaranth has an even more common name, the "fugitive plant", a
									moniker granted due to its unique survival mechanisms. It can be said from
									germination to dispersal the amaranth lives its life on the run in a continual struggle to
									remain evolutionarily and geographically ahead of climate change. But what might it

							plant is still alive. The small leathery seeds do not immediately germinate, their unique
							physiology allows them to remain dormant until finding themselves carried to an ideal
